        All learners, whatever their level, have questions and doubts about
        grammar as they’re learning English. There is also a grammar reference
        which helps to explain the verb tenses and grammar rules in a clear and
        simple way.

        Decide which area of grammar you need help with today and choose a
        grammar point to work on. When you do the interactive exercises, you can
        see how well you’ve done. By revising and practicing your grammar you
        will increase your confidence in English and improve your language
        level.

      <p className="text-justify md:text-center my-4">
        Practicing little and often is the best way to improve your grammar, so
        come back tomorrow to choose another grammar point to work on. Good
        luck!
